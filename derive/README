Development notes:

* The Data.Derive.* modules contain a comment like

  {-
  example :: Custom
  instance Foo a => Foo (Bar a) where
      bar x = $(bar)
  -}

  This comment is used by the derive tool to generate a skeleton derivation -
  this is done using the 'generate.sh' script.

  The skeleton can then be modified by providing a 'custom' function, which
  may, for example, replace splices like $(bar) by generated code.

  (In simple cases derive can deduce the whole derivation from examples, but
  ToDoc and Reader are not simple. See the derive sources for examples.)
